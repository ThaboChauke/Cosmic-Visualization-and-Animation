# Cosmic Visualizations and Animations

## Overview
This project is a collection of visual simulations inspired by space and celestial phenomena. The goal is to explore concepts in **graphics programming**, **HTML5 canvas**, and **JavaScript animations**, while applying best practices such as **separation of concerns** and **modular design**.

## Purpose
Although some of the initial code was generated, this repository serves as a learning and experimentation space, where I explore:
- **Rendering complex animations** using the HTML5 canvas.
- Understanding how to structure code for **scalability and maintainability**.
- Practicing the principles of **separation of concerns** to improve the organization of web applications.

By working on this project, I aim to grow as a developer, refine my **software engineering skills**, and create resources that others can learn from or adapt for their own projects.

## Features

1. **Galaxy Generator**  
   A simulation of a spiral galaxy where stars orbit around a central point. This creates a mesmerizing rotating star system with subtle color and movement variations.

2. **Constellation Viewer**  
   Allows users to connect stars by clicking on them, forming custom constellations. The stars randomly generate positions on the canvas, and clicking connects them with lines.

3. **Cosmic Nebula Animation**  
   Displays an animated, swirling nebula effect using particles with randomized colors and movements, resembling the dynamic motion of gas and dust in space.

4. **Black Hole Simulation**  
   Stars swirl toward a central black hole, simulating the effect of gravitational pull. The closer the stars get, the faster they move, creating a gravitational well visual.

5. **Separation of Concerns**  
   The project is structured with a clear separation of concerns. All styling is managed in CSS, the behavior is encapsulated in JavaScript, and the structure is kept simple in HTML. The aim is to create a modular design, improving maintainability and scalability of the code.

6. **Refactoring for Readability**  
   The code was refactored to improve readability and follow **best practices**. Classes and functions are used to make the code modular and easy to expand.

## Lessons Learned
This project has been an opportunity to:
- **Refactor generated code** to follow better design patterns.
- Focus on writing clean, maintainable, and scalable JavaScript.
- Dive deeper into HTML5 canvas and explore how **animation and physics** interact on a web platform.

## How to Use
You can clone the repository and open the `index.html` files in your browser to view the different visualizations. Each feature is separated into its own file for clarity.
